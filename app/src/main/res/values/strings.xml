        <b> What is Stress? </b>
        \n
         \n Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension.
            It can come from any event or thought that makes
            you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress is your
            body\'s reaction to a challenge or demand. In
            short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it
            helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline.

        <b> Types of Stress </b>
        \n
            \n 1. Acute stress
        \n Acute stress is the most common type of stress.
        It\'s your body\'s immediate reaction to
        a new challenge, event, or demand, and it triggers your
        fight-or-flight response. As the pressures of  a near-
        miss automobile accident, an argument with a family
        member, or a costly mistake at work sink in, your body
        turns on this biological response.
        \n
         \n
        \n
        2. Episodic acute stress
        \n When acute stress happens frequently, it\'s
        called episodic acute stress. People who always seem
        to be having a crisis tend to have episodic acute stress.
        They are often short-tempered, irritable, and anxious.
        \n
         \n
        \n
        3. Chronic stress
        \n If acute stress isn\'t resolved and begins to
        increase or lasts for long periods of time, it becomes
        chronic stress. This stress is constant and doesn\'t
        go away. It can stem from such things as:
        \n
        \n poverty
        \n a dysfunctional family
        \n an unhappy marriage
        \n a bad job
        \n

        \n Common internal causes of stress include:

        \n Rigid thinking, lack of flexibility

        \n
        <b>Is all stress bad?</b>
        \n
        \n
        Not all stress is bad. In fact, some stress heightens
        your senses, helping you to avoid accidents, power
        through unexpected deadlines, or stay clear-minded
        in chaotic situations. This is the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot;
        Response that your body triggers in times of duress.
        \n But stress is meant to be temporary. Your body
        should return to a natural state after the situation has
        passed. Your heart rate should slow, your muscles
        should relax, and your breathing should return to
        normal.
        \n The pressures and demands of modern life may
        put your body in a heightened state for a long period
        of time, making your heart pump hard and your blood
        vessels constrict for longer than your body can handle.
        Over time, these physiological demands can take a
        toll on your body.
